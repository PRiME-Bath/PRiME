Below are the units focussed on mathematics education, history and language offered in all programs of the department (BSc/MMath in Mathematics, BSc in Mathematics and Statistics, and BSc in Mathematics, Statistics and Data Science).\n\nFoundationsConnectionsCommunicating Maths\n\n\nYear: 1\nThis course focuses on developing strong skills to help ease the transition from school-level mathematics to university-level mathematics. It emphasises logical thinking and clear, rigorous mathematical writing as well as understanding the use of mathematical notation and building a coherent repertoire of clear mathematical thought. Students will learn how to work with definitions, axioms, theorems, and various types of proofs, as well as being able to engage in formal mathematical discourse in a clear and effective way.\nBy the end of the unit, students should be able to understand and manipulate logical statements, evaluate the validity of mathematical arguments, and confidently and clearly write their own proofs using a range of techniques.\n\n\nYear: 1\nThis course provides an introduction to the vibrant world of mathematical research within the department. Students are introduced to advanced mathematical topics and their applications in real-world contexts, including industry, society, and public engagement. They will also gain insight into the University’s outreach and advocacy efforts, highlighting the broader impact of mathematics beyond academia. This unit is a department-wide unit where one topic from every research group (Applied Mathematics; Numerical Analysis & Data Science; Statistics; Probability; Analysis; Algebra, Geometry & Number Theory; Mathematics Education & Pedagogy) is presented and explored. This will allow the students to appreciate the research that is done across the department and how this translates to real-world applications.\nBy the end of the course, students will be able to discuss the wide-ranging scope and significance of contemporary mathematical research, and appreciate its role in solving complex problems and driving innovation across various fields.\n\n\nYear: 3\nThis course introduces students to the critical evaluation of a wide range of mathematical communication formats, such as videos, articles, lessons, workshops, and events. It encourages students to reflect on how to effectively inspire, engage, and motivate different audiences when presenting mathematical content. Alongside this, students will develop a deeper understanding of the pedagogy of mathematics and how it informs communication strategies.\nAs part of the course, students will design and deliver two Mathematical Interactions, with at least one presented live (such as a group-led workshop, a masterclass, or media content). Students will then critically evaluate their own work, reflecting on its success and identifying ways to improve future outcomes.\nThroughout the course, lectures will provide a variety of examples and practical guidance on planning, delivering, and assessing mathematical communication. These are complemented by regular mentoring tutorials with course leaders, offering personalised support and feedback.\nBy the end of the unit, students will have developed an understanding of different approaches to learning mathematics, gained experience in applying a range of communication and presentation techniques appropriately, and demonstrated the ability to critically evaluate their own work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

My career progression and interests have started to shift more into mathematics education and pedagogy, and making mathematics more appealing to undergraduates and those in the general public. My roles in the department are as a lecturer in pure and applied mathematics, Outreach & Widening Particpation and the HEA Champion.\n\n\n\nIlaria Bussoli [ib641@bath.ac.uk]\nI am keen in exploring innovative and inclusive ways to make statistics more approachable to students, from gamification and hands-on activities to embedded history of Mathematics and Statistics and interactive lecture material. My focus is mostly on students without a mathematical background, and how to support them better in their learning path.\n\n\n\nThomas Cottrell [tpc40@bath.ac.uk]\nI am a pure mathematician with a background in category theory, a branch of maths in which the processes of proving and understanding a statement go hand-in-hand. Studying category theory gave me a strong sense of what does (or doesn't) constitute a well-expressed mathematical definition or proof – this led me to an interest in mathematical reading, writing and thinking, and how students develop these skills. I am also interested in the transition from school to university level, with the majority of my teaching experience being in courses for first-year maths undergraduates.\n\n\n\nJames Foadi [jf850@bath.ac.uk]\nI am an ex-theoretical physicist who sold his soul to theoretical crystallography and lately to mathematical education. I am interested in new educational and pedagogical approaches to assessment and feedback in Mathematics courses, as well as History of Mathematics.\n\n\n\nMason Pember [mp312@bath.ac.uk]\nI want to explore innovative teaching methods that are inclusive and inspire students to pursue learning beyond their degree. I am particularly interested in methods that provoke creativity.\n\n\n\nSimon Shaw [s.shaw@bath.ac.uk]\nMy interests lie in Bayesian approaches to statistics, in particular Bayes linear methods, the analysis of collections of (second-order) exchangeable sequences, graphical models and uses of conditional independence.\n\n\n\nTamsin Smith [tls35@bath.ac.uk]\nI am eager to explore how mathematics is learned and taught, especially regarding the shift in approach that students encounter when transitioning from school to higher education. I’m also interested in experimenting with innovative educational practices and assessment methods to enhance the student experience and improve outcomes.\n\n\n\nBen Sparks [bjs55@bath.ac.uk]\nI am a mathematician, musician, and public speaker. I give maths talks and workshops around the world, to students, teachers, and the general public. I am part freelance and part-time with the University of Bath where I am teaching on the Communicating Maths course, together with Tamsin Smith.\n\n\n\nJane White [maskajw@bath.ac.uk]\nI am interested in progression of assessment activity through UG programmes and assessment for learning. I am keen on developing the academic Education role, and for PRiME to be a voice for academic staff in the Education teaching pathways, as well as a nationally recognised Centre for Excellence in pedagogic practice for Mathematical Sciences.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvi Papadaki\nAnna Daupare\n\n\n\n   \n   \n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Maths Resource Centre at the University of Bath has a long history of using and developing NUMBAS questions for mathematical assessments. NUMBAS is a free open-sourced web-based system designed for creating dynamic assessment questions.\nThere are several advantages to using NUMBAS, including immediate feedback for students, which helps them to learn and adjust their understanding in real-time. The randomization feature also allows students to practice questions repeatedly with different data sets, reinforcing their skills and enhancing their learning experience. However, there are some limitations. One of the main drawbacks is the lack of personalized feedback, which means students may not receive tailored advice on their progress. Additionally, the need to code specific contexts for the questions can limit the extent of randomization, potentially reducing the variety of practice scenarios.\nThe MAST service of the Maths Resource Centre, led by us, has expanded the use of NUMBAS questions by incorporating them as creative tools within the teaching process. One of the first innovations was to contextualize the mathematics for different disciplines. This initiative began in response to a request from a specific subject area where students needed to develop mathematical and data analysis skills to support their subject understanding and problem-solving. It was also a response to the diverse entry profiles of the student cohort.\nFurther developments include collaborations where NUMBAS has been used in summative assessments, featuring randomised data sets. Additionally, it has been embedded in lecture materials as a live teaching tool, enhancing the overall learning experience.\nIf you’re interested in our work, take a look at our poster presented at the INDRUM 2024 conference, or explore some examples of the questions developed by the team below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

To address this challenge, we piloted for an alternative model for year 1algebra tutorials that ran alongside the standard model. This opportunity provided focused, slower-paced delivery with personalised revision, and confidence-building support.\nIn this talk we will discuss the rationale and implementation of this pilot and reflect on the successes and challenges.\nThis pilot project was funded by the Teaching Development Fund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 25/03/2026 - TBC, Paola Iannone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaker: Paola Iannone\n\n\n\n\n\nPaola Inannone completed a first degree in mathematics at the University degli study di Roma La Sapienza (Rome - Italy) and PhD in Pure Mathematics the University of East Anglia (UEA).

The motivation for such courses is to introduce mathematics students to the field of mathematics education research or/and to prepare them for mathematics teaching. Research in mathematics education, however, is a very different enterprise from research in mathematics. For example, in mathematics education, much research focuses on human interactions and the social, cultural and educational contexts in which these interactions take place. While there is some attention to mathematical errors students make, there is also more focus on the reasons behind the error. Approaches are more relativist on what constitutes knowledge and evidence is not in the form of ‘proof’ as we know in mathematics. Balancing attention to the practices of mathematics (what I will call mathematical discourses) with attention to the practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics (what I will call pedagogical discourses) is an exciting challenge. In this session, I will discuss how I address this challenge in a course that introduces mathematics education to undergraduate mathematics students. Specifically, I will share examples of course activities that draw on the principles of the MathTASK, a research and development programme that I co-lead at UEA. In MathTASK, we engage teachers or students with fictional but realistic classroom situations and ask them to reflect on these situations (we call these activities “mathtasks”). We will discuss one or more mathtasks inspired by current debates on the impact of genAI on students’ development of mathematical problem-solving skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n 19/11/2025 - Flipping the Foundations, Robert Wilson\nSpeaker: Robert Wilson\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nThis presentation will discuss a reimagining of a large, core, undergraduate mathematics module by implementing a flipped learning approach. Specific focus for the session will include:\n\nthe rationale behind the change;\nhighlighting examples of the activities and resources developed;\nthe impact on learners (and facilitators);\npotential future enhancements and challenges.\n\nThere will also be significant opportunity to discuss and debate the ideas raised in further detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 13/11/2024 - Statistical Models For Improving Maths Tests\nSpeaker: Adam Coates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nIn virtually all teaching contexts where instructors design their own classroom assessments, a combination of common-sense, intuition, and heuristics are used to decide whether the test was fit for purpose. There are, however, methods from the field of psychometrics which can be used to more objectively judge whether a test is working well and indicate areas for potential improvement. This seminar will first outline common practices in university assessment, then introduce item-response theory and diagnostic classification modelling as tools which can be used to improve these practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 20/11/2024 - HEA Fellowships in Maths\nSpeaker: Waleed Ali\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nThis session will be open to everyone; staff, postgraduate students and anyone involved in teaching or teaching-based leadership roles. I will be giving an overview about applying for HEA Fellowships, especially after the release of the new specifications that will take effect in January 2025. The session will cover all the requirements for applying for the different HEA accreditations that the university provides (Associate Fellow, Fellow and Senior Fellow); following, there will be a Q&A session where I’ll answer any questions you might have about the accreditation process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26/02/2025 - Filling the Gap: Finding Your Niche\nSpeaker: Kat Phillips\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nAs academics we are continually taught to push the boundaries on current knowledge with our research, through either seeing where improvements can be made with current methods or scoping out underserved areas of the field. This attitude, combined with the ethos of ‘keeping things fun’, has served me well not only in my research, but in the rest of my life as well. Alongside my PhD I began developing my career as a maths communicator and academic advocate under the name ‘KatDoesMaths’. In this talk I want to share with you some of the projects I’ve created and been involved with, and the things I learnt along the way (including the good, the bad, and the ugly!) I will also highlight some useful tips and tricks that have been invaluable to me in all styles of communication practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26/03/2025 - Understanding and Promoting Meaningful Learning Experiences in Undergraduate Mathematical Education\nSpeaker: Cathy Smith\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematics lecturers rarely have a background in education theory, nor the time to learn how to read it. But without awareness of theory, our scholarship of teaching and learning can be limited in its criticality and its comprehensibility to others. This seminar offers a gentle introduction to one theoretical framing of learning – Garrison’s Community of Inquiry - chosen because it has been widely used to analyse blended and online learning, including in some of my own work. At its simplest, the framework suggests attending to the three dimensions of social, teaching and cognitive presence in an educational situation. The seminar will cover definitions of these dimensions, some examples (from 2018 onwards) of how I and others have used it specifically in mathematics, with time for thoughts and questions about its relevance and/or limitations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 01/11/2023 - Interactive Mathematics with VisualPDE\nSpeaker: Ben Walker\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nBen introduces us to VisualPDE, an online resource he has developed for exploring, teaching, and broadly communicating partial differential equations. This resource is already being used in universities in the UK and worldwide and hopes to bring rich interactivity to a subject where there are often high barriers to entry. Unlike most seminars, Ben encouraged participants to bring along a smartphone, tablet or laptop to the session, so that they could interact with the site and play with PDEs, live on their device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/11/2023 - Generative AI in Mathematics Teaching & Learning\nSpeaker: Ben Adams\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nBen will present a summary of some recent articles that explore the performance of generative AI on school and university mathematical problems. This may be a first step towards understanding the role of generative AI in our own teaching and assessment practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 13/12/2023 - Promoting Participation With Statistics: Innovations for Teaching\nSpeaker: William Kay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistics is a key skill for bioscience students, but for this audience, learning statistics is typically challenging. Many students suffer from “statistics anxiety”, and tackling this is barrier to learning is hence a priority. In Cardiff University’s School of Biosciences, we are working to design a remodelled “spiral curriculum” for biostatistics. In this seminar I will present some of the new pedagogic approaches that I have been developing to facilitate this approach, as well as the ways that I am working to mitigate and overcome statistics anxiety in our students. These approaches include embedding statistics in biological practicals and assessments, providing tailored support at Undergraduate Data Clinics, and designing “Statistics Shorts”. More broadly, I will touch on several other of the pedagogic approaches that have been shown to make statistics not only understandable, but also enjoyable. Finally, I will share some insights into my own (challenging) history of learning statistics, and highlight how an empathetic and compassionate approach can make all the difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 28/02/2024 - Making Mathematics Lectures More Engaging\nSpeaker: Lara Alcock\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk will cover 18 simple practices that can be used to make ordinary mathematics lectures more engaging. It will start with general principles and organisational matters, then provide illustrations of short, snappy in-lecture activities that can be adapted for any topic. These activities require minimal planning, they work individually or together, and they can be incorporated into lectures in standard ways. They are also aligned with research on effective learning, and the talk will include light-touch comments on related research evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 13/03/2024 - How to Start in the World of Mathematics Education Research\nSpeaker: Evi Papadaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigating the world of Mathematics Education Research as a novice can feel both exciting and confusing at the same time. The aim of the talk is to map out the field of Mathematics Education Research through a collection of examples and personal experiences. First, I will highlight what sets Mathematics Education Research apart from Educational Research. I will aim to answer questions I had as a newcomer with practical examples. Then, we will work together on finding ways to embed practice-based research in our teaching practice. We will consider personal interests in conjunction with practical limitations such as time and resources. Finally, I will conclude with tips and resources that could help you find your own path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 27/03/2024 - How to Think Like a Mathematician\nSpeaker: Kevin Houston\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this talk, Kevin will speak about the transition from school to university-level mathematics and highlight the reasons why it can be a daunting journey for many students. This talk aims to provide insights into what Kevin has done to ease this transition for his students. He will explore the key differences between school and university mathematics and describe practical strategies for teaching logical thinking, dealing with proof, and presenting mathematics in oral and written forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 10/04/2024 - Students as Agents of Change: Partners & Researchers\nSpeaker: Martyn Parker\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this talk, I will explore how we developed and deployed our department’s new Student Engagement and Community strategy. The strategy aims to create a culture of opportunities to ensure our students are fully active participants in various decision-making, initiatives, and projects, including developing and enhancing their experience and community. The work has supported individual, curriculum, community, and departmental developments that connect our students with, for example, research, other departments, and university decision-makers.\nThis strategy has proved fruitful in engaging students in research projects driven by external and regulatory priorities. Discipline-specific pedagogy can be overlooked in these cases, but these projects provide a solid evidence base for informed judgements. I will highlight a few successes delivered by our student researchers and the benefits this approach has brought to the department and institution."
