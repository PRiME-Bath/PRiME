    "text": "We teach across the entire range of mathematical subjects and disciplines. Below are the units focussed on mathematics education, history and language offered in all programs of the department (BSc/MMath in Mathematics, BSc in Mathematics and Statistics, and BSc in Mathematics, Statistics and Data Science).\n\nFoundationsConnectionsCommunicating Maths\n\n\nYear 1\nThe Foundations unit is a part of the MA12001 Pure Mathematics 1A unit. This course focuses on developing strong skills to help ease the transition from school-level mathematics to university-level mathematics. It emphasises logical thinking and clear, rigorous mathematical writing as well as understanding the use of mathematical notation and building a coherent repertoire of clear mathematical thought. Students will learn how to work with definitions, axioms, theorems, and various types of proofs, as well as being able to engage in formal mathematical discourse in a clear and effective way.\nBy the end of the unit, students should be able to understand and manipulate logical statements, evaluate the validity of mathematical arguments, and confidently and clearly write their own proofs using a range of techniques.\n\n\nYear 1\nThe Connections unit is a part of the MA12004 Pure Mathematics 1B unit. This course provides an introduction to the vibrant world of mathematical research within the maths department Bath. Students are introduced to advanced mathematical topics and their applications in real-world contexts, including industry, society, and public engagement. They will also gain insight into the University’s outreach and advocacy efforts, highlighting the broader impact of mathematics beyond academia. This unit is a department-wide unit where one topic from every research group is presented and explored. This will allow the students to appreciate the research that is done across the department and how this translates to real-world applications. These research groups are:\n\nAIMS (Applied & Interdisciplinary Mathematics Seminars);\nNA+DS (Numerical Analysis & Data Science);\nStatistics;\nProb@Lab (Probability;\nAnalysis;\nAGeNT (Algebra, Geometry & Number Theory);\nPRiME (Practice and Research in Mathematical sciences Education).\n\nBy the end of the unit, students will be able to discuss the wide-ranging scope and significance of contemporary mathematical research, and appreciate its role in solving complex problems and driving innovation across various fields.\n\n\nYear 3\nThis Communicating Maths unit introduces students to the critical evaluation of a wide range of mathematical communication formats, such as videos, articles, lessons, workshops, and events. It encourages students to reflect on how to effectively inspire, engage, and motivate different audiences when presenting mathematical content. Alongside this, students will develop a deeper understanding of the pedagogy of mathematics and how it informs communication strategies.\nAs part of the course, students will design and deliver two Mathematical Interactions, with at least one presented live (such as a group-led workshop, a masterclass, or media content). Students will then critically evaluate their own work, reflecting on its success and identifying ways to improve future outcomes.\nThroughout the course, lectures will provide a variety of examples and practical guidance on planning, delivering, and assessing mathematical communication. These are complemented by regular mentoring tutorials with course leaders, offering personalised support and feedback.\nBy the end of the unit, students will have developed an understanding of different approaches to learning mathematics, gained experience in applying a range of communication and presentation techniques appropriately, and demonstrated the ability to critically evaluate their own work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

My career progression and interests have started to shift more into mathematics education and pedagogy, and making mathematics more appealing to undergraduates and those in the general public. My roles in the department are as a lecturer in pure and applied mathematics, Outreach & Widening Participation and the HEA Champion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIlaria Bussoli ib641@bath.ac.uk\nI am keen in exploring innovative and inclusive ways to make statistics more approachable to students, from gamification and hands-on activities to embedded history of Mathematics and Statistics and interactive lecture material. My focus is mostly on students without a mathematical background, and how to support them better in their learning path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Cottrell tpc40@bath.ac.uk\nI am a pure mathematician with a background in category theory, a branch of maths in which the processes of proving and understanding a statement go hand-in-hand. Studying category theory gave me a strong sense of what does (or doesn’t) constitute a well-expressed mathematical definition or proof – this led me to an interest in mathematical reading, writing and thinking, and how students develop these skills. I am also interested in the transition from school to university level, with the majority of my teaching experience being in courses for first-year maths undergraduates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Foadi jf850@bath.ac.uk\nI am an ex-theoretical physicist who sold his soul to theoretical crystallography and lately to mathematical education. I am interested in new educational and pedagogical approaches to assessment and feedback in Mathematics courses, as well as History of Mathematics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMason Pember mp312@bath.ac.uk\nI want to explore innovative teaching methods that are inclusive and inspire students to pursue learning beyond their degree. I am particularly interested in methods that provoke creativity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimon Shaw s.shaw@bath.ac.uk\nMy interests lie in Bayesian approaches to statistics, in particular Bayes linear methods, the analysis of collections of (second-order) exchangeable sequences, graphical models and uses of conditional independence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTamsin Smith tls35@bath.ac.uk\nI am eager to explore how mathematics is learned and taught, especially regarding the shift in approach that students encounter when transitioning from school to higher education. I’m also interested in experimenting with innovative educational practices and assessment methods to enhance the student experience and improve outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBen Sparks bjs55@bath.ac.uk\nI am a mathematician, musician, and public speaker. I give maths talks and workshops around the world, to students, teachers, and the general public. I am part freelance and part-time with the University of Bath where I am teaching on the Communicating Maths course, together with Tamsin Smith.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJane White maskajw@bath.ac.uk\nI am interested in progression of assessment activity through UG programmes and assessment for learning. I am keen on developing the academic Education role, and for PRiME to be a voice for academic staff in the Education teaching pathways, as well as a nationally recognised Centre for Excellence in pedagogic practice for Mathematical Sciences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Anna Daupare\n\n\n\n\n\n Evi Papadaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Maths Resource Centre at the University of Bath has a long history of using and developing NUMBAS questions for mathematical assessments. NUMBAS is a free open-sourced web-based system designed for creating dynamic assessment questions.\nThere are several advantages to using NUMBAS, including immediate feedback for students, which helps them to learn and adjust their understanding in real-time. The randomization feature also allows students to practice questions repeatedly with different data sets, reinforcing their skills and enhancing their learning experience. However, there are some limitations. One of the main drawbacks is the lack of personalized feedback, which means students may not receive tailored advice on their progress. Additionally, the need to code specific contexts for the questions can limit the extent of randomization, potentially reducing the variety of practice scenarios.\nThe MAST service of the Maths Resource Centre, led by us, has expanded the use of NUMBAS questions by incorporating them as creative tools within the teaching process. One of the first innovations was to contextualize the mathematics for different disciplines. This initiative began in response to a request from a specific subject area where students needed to develop mathematical and data analysis skills to support their subject understanding and problem-solving. It was also a response to the diverse entry profiles of the student cohort.\nFurther developments include collaborations where NUMBAS has been used in summative assessments, featuring randomised data sets. Additionally, it has been embedded in lecture materials as a live teaching tool, enhancing the overall learning experience.\nIf you’re interested in our work, take a look at our poster presented at the INDRUM 2024 conference, or explore some examples of the questions developed by the team below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

To address this challenge, we piloted for an alternative model for year 1 algebra tutorials that ran alongside the standard model. This opportunity provided focused, slower-paced delivery with personalised revision, and confidence-building support.\nIn this talk we will discuss the rationale and implementation of this pilot and reflect on the successes and challenges.\nThis pilot project was funded by the Teaching Development Fund."
