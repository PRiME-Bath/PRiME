**Speaker**:  [Ilaria Bussoli](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/ilaria-bussoli/)

**Abstract**:  In this talk, I will talk about the on-going teaching resources repository project developed by members of the History for Inclusion & Diversity in Mathematics (HIDIM) network ([History For Inclusion & Diversity in Mathematics Network](https://mathshist4edi.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/)), and my contribution to it. This is a repository of mathematical and statistical teaching resources that embed Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) content to diversify sub honours modules in maths curricula. I will discuss the principles behind it, how you can engage with it, and how this fits within the scope of the HIDIM network.

**Abstract**:  Over recent semesters, the Department of Mathematical Sciences has observed a consistent decline in tutorial attendance beyond the mid-semester point, suggesting that many students disengage after falling behind with course material. To address this challenge, we piloted for an alternative model for year 1 algebra tutorials that ran alongside the standard model. This opportunity provided focused, slower-paced delivery with personalised revision, and confidence-building support.

In this talk we will discuss the rationale and implementation of this pilot and reflect on the successes and challenges.

This pilot project was funded by the Teaching Development Fund.

**Speakers**:  [Paola Iannone](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/paola-iannone/) is  Professor of Mathematics Education in the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh and the Head of the The Technology Enhanced Mathematical Sciences Education Theme. She is  also visiting fellow in  the School of Education and Lifelong Learning at the University of East Anglia. Paola completed a first degree in mathematics at the University degli study di Roma La Sapienza (Rome - Italy) and PhD in Pure Mathematics the University of East Anglia (UEA). Her research focuses on the teaching and learning of mathematics at university level and has three strands:

- Summative assessment of mathematics at university with focus on the impact of the discipline of study and student epistemological beliefs on their perceptions of assessment and the use of oral assessment in university mathematics,
- Mathematical reasoning and technology in university mathematics (use of automated theorem provers such as Lean - CAA assessment),
- The transition from school to university mathematics.

**Speaker:** [Irene Biza](https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/irene-biza)

:::{.callout-note title="Abstract" icon=false collapse=true}
Some mathematics undergraduate programs include in their syllabi also courses on mathematics education. The motivation for such courses is to introduce mathematics students to the field of mathematics education research or/and to prepare them for mathematics teaching. Research in mathematics education, however, is a very different enterprise from research in mathematics. For example, in mathematics education, much research focuses on human interactions and the social, cultural and educational contexts in which these interactions take place. While there is some attention to mathematical errors students make, there is also more focus on the reasons behind the error. Approaches are more relativist on what constitutes knowledge and evidence is not in the form of ‘proof’ as we know in mathematics. Balancing attention to the practices of mathematics (what I will call mathematical discourses) with attention to the practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics (what I will call pedagogical discourses) is an exciting challenge.  In this session, I will discuss how I address this challenge in a course that introduces mathematics education to undergraduate mathematics students. Specifically, I will share examples of course activities that draw on the principles of the [MathTASK](https://www.uea.ac.uk/groups-and-centres/a-z/mathtask), a research and development programme that I co-lead at UEA. In MathTASK, we engage teachers or students with fictional but realistic classroom situations and ask them to reflect on these situations (we call these activities “mathtasks”). We will discuss one or more mathtasks inspired by current debates on the impact of genAI on students’ development of mathematical problem-solving skills.

**Speaker:** [Adam Coates](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/adam-coates)

:::{.callout-note title="Abstract" icon=false collapse=true}
In virtually all teaching contexts where instructors design their own classroom assessments, a combination of common-sense, intuition, and heuristics are used to decide whether the test was fit for purpose. There are, however, methods from the field of psychometrics which can be used to more objectively judge whether a test is working well and indicate areas for potential improvement. This seminar will first outline common practices in university assessment, then introduce item-response theory and diagnostic classification modelling as tools which can be used to improve these practices.

**Speaker:** [Kat Phillips](https://katdoesmaths.me/)

:::{.callout-note title="Abstract" icon=false collapse=true}
As academics we are continually taught to push the boundaries on current knowledge with our research, through either seeing where improvements can be made with current methods or scoping out underserved areas of the field. This attitude, combined with the ethos of 'keeping things fun', has served me well not only in my research, but in the rest of my life as well. Alongside my PhD I began developing my career as a maths communicator and academic advocate under the name 'KatDoesMaths'. In this talk I want to share with you some of the projects I've created and been involved with, and the things I learnt along the way (including the good, the bad, and the ugly!) I will also highlight some useful tips and tricks that have been invaluable to me in all styles of communication practice.

**Speaker:** [Cathy Smith](https://profiles.open.ac.uk/cathy-smith)

:::{.callout-note title="Abstract" icon=false collapse=true}
Mathematics lecturers rarely have a background in education theory, nor the time to learn how to read it. But without awareness of theory, our scholarship of teaching and learning can be limited in its criticality and its comprehensibility to others. This seminar offers a gentle introduction to one theoretical framing of learning – Garrison's Community of Inquiry - chosen because it has been widely used to analyse blended and online learning, including in some of my own work. At its simplest, the framework suggests attending to the three dimensions of social, teaching and cognitive presence in an educational situation. The seminar will cover definitions of these dimensions, some examples (from 2018 onwards) of how I and others have used it specifically in mathematics, with time for thoughts and questions about its relevance and/or limitations.

:::{.callout-note title="Abstract" icon=false collapse=true}
Ben introduces us to [VisualPDE](https://visualpde.com/), an online resource he has developed for exploring, teaching, and broadly communicating partial differential equations. This resource is already being used in universities in the UK and worldwide and hopes to bring rich interactivity to a subject where there are often high barriers to entry. Unlike most seminars, Ben encouraged participants to bring along a smartphone, tablet or laptop to the session, so that they could interact with the site and play with PDEs, live on their device.

**Speaker:** [William Kay](https://willpkay.weebly.com/)

:::{.callout-note title="Abstract" icon=false collapse=true}
Statistics is a key skill for bioscience students, but for this audience, learning statistics is typically challenging. Many students suffer from "statistics anxiety", and tackling this is barrier to learning is hence a priority. In Cardiff University's School of Biosciences, we are working to design a remodelled "spiral curriculum" for biostatistics. In this seminar I will present some of the new pedagogic approaches that I have been developing to facilitate this approach, as well as the ways that I am working to mitigate and overcome statistics anxiety in our students. These approaches include embedding statistics in biological practicals and assessments, providing tailored support at Undergraduate Data Clinics, and designing "Statistics Shorts". More broadly, I will touch on several other of the pedagogic approaches that have been shown to make statistics not only understandable, but also enjoyable. Finally, I will share some insights into my own (challenging) history of learning statistics, and highlight how an empathetic and compassionate approach can make all the difference.

:::{.callout-note title="Abstract" icon=false collapse=true}
This talk will cover 18 simple practices that can be used to make ordinary mathematics lectures more engaging. It will start with general principles and organisational matters, then provide illustrations of short, snappy in-lecture activities that can be adapted for any topic. These activities require minimal planning, they work individually or together, and they can be incorporated into lectures in standard ways. They are also aligned with research on effective learning, and the talk will include light-touch comments on related research evidence.

:::{.callout-note title="Abstract" icon=false collapse=true}
Navigating the world of Mathematics Education Research as a novice can feel both exciting and confusing at the same time. The aim of the talk is to map out the field of Mathematics Education Research through a collection of examples and personal experiences. First, I will highlight what sets Mathematics Education Research apart from Educational Research. I will aim to answer questions I had as a newcomer with practical examples. Then, we will work together on finding ways to embed practice-based research in our teaching practice. We will consider personal interests in conjunction with practical limitations such as time and resources. Finally, I will conclude with tips and resources that could help you find your own path.

**Speaker:** [Martyn Parker](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/parker/)

:::{.callout-note title="Abstract" icon=false collapse=true}
In this talk, I will explore how we developed and deployed our department's new Student Engagement and Community strategy. The strategy aims to create a culture of opportunities to ensure our students are fully active participants in various decision-making, initiatives, and projects, including developing and enhancing their experience and community. The work has supported individual, curriculum, community, and departmental developments that connect our students with, for example, research, other departments, and university decision-makers.

This strategy has proved fruitful in engaging students in research projects driven by external and regulatory priorities. Discipline-specific pedagogy can be overlooked in these cases, but these projects provide a solid evidence base for informed judgements. I will highlight a few successes delivered by our student researchers and the benefits this approach has brought to the department and institution.
