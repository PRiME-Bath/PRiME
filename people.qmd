My interests now lie in teaching pure mathematics from a tangible point of view, that is more appealing to students who are starting their university education.</td>

My focus is mostly on students without a mathematical background, and how to support them better in their learning path.</td>

Studying category theory gave me a strong sense of what does (or doesn't) constitute a well-expressed mathematical definition or proof – this led me to an interest in mathematical reading, writing and thinking, and how students develop these skills. I am also interested in the transition from school to university level, with the majority of my teaching experience being in courses for first-year maths undergraduates.</td>
